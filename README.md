# angular2to1 Project
An angular 2 to angular 1 Shim - Write angular 2 components with angular 1

## Why
An angular 2 to angular 1 function.
This function should provide **ES5** syntax of angular v2 to be used with angular 1
reasons:  
1. You want to learn angular 2 syntax  
2. You still want to develop with angular 1  
3. You want to ease migration (when possible) of angular 1 to 2
